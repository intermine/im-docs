InterMine Development Roadmap
=============================

InterMine is a noncommercial, free software project, and as such there
is no formal list of feature requirements required for development.

We ensure that all new features committed to InterMine are thoroughly
vetted by our community of contributors and committers.

Upcoming minor releases
-----------------------

The InterMine project aims to make at least one minor release every
quarter. If it becomes necessary due to an important bugfix or security
issue, more releases will be made, so this list should be considered a
minimum.

The current schedule for upcoming releases is:

> -   Spring 2020 (4.2.0)
> -   Fall 2020 (4.3.0)

Next major release
------------------

The next major release of InterMine is planned to be InterMine 5.0.0.
