Tutorial
========

The InterMine API is made more accessible through
the publication of a number of client libraries in
different languages. For the purposes of this tutorial
we will use the Python client library for the illustration
of examples, but any of the client libraries (in Perl, Java,
Ruby and JavaScript) provides similar functionality.
Similarly we will use FlyMine (www.flymine.org) as an
example of an InterMine web-service, but the techniques
discussed here are applicable for any of available
implementations.

Logging In / Authenticating
---------------------------

In the web-application interface we 'log in' to gain
access to our personal data. When using the web-service
API we speak of authentication as the process whereby
your requests are mapped to a particular user account.

The recommended manner of authentication is through the
use of API tokens; you can get yours by visiting the 
appropriate section of the web-application
(http://www.flymine.org/query/mymine?tab=api). The token
is a long string which is unique across the mine - since
its use is equivalent to your password, remember to keep
it safe.

You can authenticate with a mine as follows:

.. code-block:: python

  from intermine.webservice import Service

  flymine = Service('www.flymine.org/query', token = 'abcd')

If the URL for the mine is incorrect, or the token is, an error
will be thrown.

While it is also possible use your username and password to
authenticate with the webservice. This is strongly discouraged,
due to the security implications of transmitting your password,
not to mention storing it on disk in order to use it in code.

Managing your Personal Data: Lists
---------------------------------------------------

One of the main reasons to use the webservices is to read and
manipulate the data important to you, and lists are the main way to
manage this.

To read the set of lists you have access to:

.. code-block:: python

  from intermine.webservice import Service

  flymine = Service('www.flymine.org/query', token = TOKEN)
  for imlist in flymine.get_all_lists():
    print imlist.name

To calculate the enrichment results for a given list:

.. code-block:: python

  mylist = flymine.get_list('demo-list')
  for item in mylist.calculate_enrichment('pathway_enrichment'):
    print item.identifier, item.description, item.p_value

Creating a list from a file with identifiers in it is as
straight-forward as naming that file:

.. code-block:: python
  
  new_list = flymine.create_list("some/file/with.ids", "Gene")

If the identifiers are already in memory, in anything iterable,
then that can be used instead. In the following case a string will
be built up by reading the results of a database query.

.. code-block:: python
  
  idents = db.query('SELECT identifier FROM GENE WHERE ...')
  new_list = flymine.create_list(idents, "Gene")

Lists can be combined with standard set operations, which are
overloaded in the languages that support such features:

.. code-block:: python

 list_on_server = service.get_list("On server")
 in_both = new_list & list_on_server
 in_both.name = "Intersection %s and %s" % (new_list, list_on_server)
 for gene in in_both:
    do_something_with(gene)

Running a simple workflow:
--------------------------

We should have enough pieces now to put together a simple workflow,
that demonstrates the kinds of operations we want to put together and
how they may be combined.

Try and develop a script which will:
  * Read all the files in a directory
  * Create a list for each one from their contents, named after the
    file.
  * Find the pathways for which the genes in each list are enriched
    above a certaint threshold.
  * Create a list of those pathways.


Regions
-------

One can query for features in a region as follows:

.. code-block:: python

   from interminebio import RegionQuery

   org = "D. melanogaster"
   feature_types = ["Exon", "Intron"]
   regions =  ["2L:14614843..14619614"]

   q = RegionQuery(flymine, org, features, regions, is_interbase = false)

   for fasta in q.fasta():
       print fasta

The items can be saved in a list and then used in any other query.

.. code-block:: python

   flymine.create_list(q, name = "List from Regions")

Queries
-------

The interface for creating queries borrows syntax and terminology from
other DB query libraries.

.. code-block:: python

   query = s.query("Gene").\
             select("*", "pathways.*").\
             where("GENE", "IN", "demo-list").\
             order_by("symbol")
   for row in query.rows(start=10, size=5):
       handle_row(row)
