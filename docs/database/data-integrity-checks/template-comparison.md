Template Comparison
================================

We have written a script that runs queries against the templates publicly available in a mine or a pair of mines. The purpose of these scripts is to:

	* Test that all templates run.
	* In the case of multiple mines, check that updates haven't radically changed the results.

The script presents their results on standard out, with the option to have them emailed upon completion of the comparison. To have results emailed out, you should have set up and installed `sendmail` on the machine running the comparison.

The script is located here: https://github.com/intermine/intermine-release-scripts/blob/master/compare_templates_for_releases.py

Python Script
----------------

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This script will run on `cPython` 2.5-2.7, `pypy` and `jython`. It requires the installation of the intermine client module, which can be installed from http://pypi.python.org PyPi with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ sudo easy_install intermine


Invocation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The script can be invoked most simply against a single mine as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ python compare_templates_for_releases.py www.flymine.org/flymine

To have results emailed, add your email address:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ python compare_templates_for_releases.py www.flymine.org/flymine you@your.host.org

Optionally set a ''from'' address:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ python compare_templates_for_releases.py www.flymine.org/flymine you@your.host.org noreply@blackhole.net

Comparing against two mines is as above, except you simply need to add a second service location:

.. code-block:: bash

	python compare_templates_for_releases.py www.flymine.org/flymine beta.flymine.org/beta you@your.host.org


Results
----------

The resulting email will look like this:

#. '''In Both: Diff >= 10%''' - templates run in both mines and result counts returned were very different.  
#. '''Only in''' - template was found in one mine and not the other.
#. '''In Both: Diff < 10%''' - template run in both mines and results returned were different.  It's probably safe to assume these are okay.
