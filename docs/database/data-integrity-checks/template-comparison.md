Template Comparison
===================

We have written a script that runs queries against the templates
publicly available in a mine or a pair of mines. The purpose of these
scripts is to:

> -   Test that all templates run.
> -   In the case of multiple mines, check that updates haven\'t
>     radically changed the results.

The script presents their results on standard out, with the option to
have them emailed upon completion of the comparison. To have results
emailed out, you should have set up and installed [sendmail]{.title-ref}
on the machine running the comparison.

The script is located here:
<https://github.com/intermine/intermine-release-scripts/blob/master/compare_templates_for_releases.py>

Python Script
-------------

### Dependencies

This script will run on [cPython]{.title-ref} 2.5-2.7,
[pypy]{.title-ref} and [jython]{.title-ref}. It requires the
installation of the intermine client module, which can be installed from
<http://pypi.python.org> PyPi with the following command:

``` {.bash}
$ sudo easy_install intermine
```

### Invocation

The script can be invoked most simply against a single mine as follows:

``` {.bash}
$ python compare_templates_for_releases.py www.flymine.org/flymine
```

To have results emailed, add your email address:

``` {.bash}
$ python compare_templates_for_releases.py www.flymine.org/flymine you@your.host.org
```

Optionally set a \'\'from\'\' address:

``` {.bash}
$ python compare_templates_for_releases.py www.flymine.org/flymine you@your.host.org noreply@blackhole.net
```

Comparing against two mines is as above, except you simply need to add a
second service location:

``` {.bash}
python compare_templates_for_releases.py www.flymine.org/flymine beta.flymine.org/beta you@your.host.org
```

Results

The resulting email will look like this:

1.  \'\'\'In Both: Diff \>= 10%\'\'\' - templates run in both mines and
    result counts returned were very different.
2.  \'\'\'Only in\'\'\' - template was found in one mine and not the
    other.
3.  \'\'\'In Both: Diff \< 10%\'\'\' - template run in both mines and
    results returned were different. It\'s probably safe to assume these
    are okay.
