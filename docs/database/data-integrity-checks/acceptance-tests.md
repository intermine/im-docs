Acceptance Tests
================================

How to run the tests
--------------------

1. Add a file to `MINE_NAME/dbmodel/resources`, eg. `flymine_acceptance_test.conf`
2. run acceptance tests here:

.. code-block:: bash

    ~/git/flymine $ ./gradlew runAcceptanceTests

The results will be in `MINE_NAME/dbmodel/build/acceptance_test.html`

Types of tests 
--------------------

You can assert that a query returns true:

.. code-block:: guess

	assert {
   		sql: select count(*) >= 400000 from goannotation
	}


Or doesn't have any results:

.. code-block:: guess

	no-results {
   		sql: select * from datasource where url is null or name is null or description is null
   		note: all fields of data source should be filled in
	}

Or has at least some results:

.. code-block:: guess

	some-results {
   		sql: select * from organism where name = 'Anopheles gambiae'
   		note: We should have an Anopheles gambiae  object but not an Anopheles gambiae PEST one
	}

.. index:: data integrity, acceptance tests
