Useful ObjectStore properties
=============================

You can configure some parameters to update how queries are handled by setting these in your mine.properties file. If you do not, the default values will be used.

os.query.max-query-parse-time
---------------------------------

InterMine includes a cost-based query optimiser that attempts to rewrite SQL queries to make use of precomputed tables. This involved parsing SQL strings into a Java representation, which is normally very fast but if multiple OR constraints are found in large queries can be slow.

There is a timeout to prevent query parsing from taking too long, if the time is exceeded a query will run as normal without possible optimisation. The default can be overridden by setting ``os.query.max-query-parse-time`` in ``*mine.properties`` to an integer value defining a number of milliseconds.

Used in `QueryOptimiserContext.java`.

os.query.max-time
---------------------------------

When the query is executed, via `ObjectStoreInterMineImpl.executeWithConnection()`, `SQL EXPLAIN <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/sql-explain.html>`_ is run on the generated query. If the estimated time to complete the query is more than the `max-time` parameter set, the query will fail.

Defaults to 100000000 milliseconds.

os.query.max-limit
---------------------------------

When the query is executed, via `ObjectStoreInterMineImpl.executeWithConnection()`, `SQL EXPLAIN <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/sql-explain.html>`_ is run on the generated query. If the estimated number of rows is more than the `max-limit` parameter set, the query will fail.

Note this relies on Postgres's statistics being up to date and correct, be sure to run `ANALYSE`.

Defaults to 100000000 rows.

os.query.max-offset
---------------------------------

Sets the maximum number of rows available to export.

If the offset for a query is greater than the `os.query.max-offset`, the query will fail to run. See `TableExportAction.checkTable()` for the exact ExportException used.

.. code-block:: java

    // exception thrown in TableExportAction.checkTable()
    if (pt.getExactSize() > pt.getMaxRetrievableIndex()) {
        throw new ExportException("Result is too big for export. "
            + "Table for export can have at the most "
            + pt.getMaxRetrievableIndex() + " rows.");
    }

Defaults to 100000000 rows.

os.queue-len
---------------------------------
