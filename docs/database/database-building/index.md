Database Building
================================

A 'build' of a mine is a complete data loading run starting from an empty database. It is recommended that you use the :doc:`/database/database-building/build-script`. The build script runs the data integration and any post-processing steps.

Each mine has an integrate project that reads the project.xml file and builds the data warehouse. This steps through each `source` defined in the project.xml file and transates the specified data from a source format and loads it into the production database. Data integration is governed by primary keys, any conflicts are resolved by a priorities config file.
