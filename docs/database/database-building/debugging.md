Given a ProxyReference, but id not in ID Map
--------------------------------------------

### Error message

``` {.guess}
java.lang.RuntimeException: Exception while dataloading - to allow multiple errors, set the property "dataLoader.allowMultipleErrors" to true Problem while loading item identifier 6_1083 because Given a ProxyReference, but id not in ID Map. Source object ID: <ProxyReference os: org.intermine.objectstore.translating.ObjectStoreTranslatingImpl@1607c7a, id:  66342, proxied class: interface org.intermine.model.InterMineObject>
```

### Problem

This error means the code tried to store an object that was referenced
by another object but could not find it. This means you\'ve set a
reference to an object, but not stored that referenced object in the
database.

Here\'s an example:

``` {.java}
// set reference to organism object
gene.setReference("organism", organism);
// store gene object
store(gene)
// never store organism object!
```

Gene now refers to an object that does not exist in the database. To
fix, make sure you are storing all the correct objects in your code.

### Solution

Make sure your code is correct and refers only to objects that are going
to be stored in the database.

-   Unit tests for this data source should be updated to check for these
    cases.
-   If you are loading XML created by another script, be sure to
    validate the data before loading.

To find out which object is not being stored, use the [item
identifier]{.title-ref} listed in the error message \-- in this case,
[6_1083]{.title-ref}. Look in the [items]{.title-ref} database to
determine the values for this object.

``` {.sql}
select * from item where identifier = '6_1083'
```

This gives s the class and item id:

``` {.guess}
implementations | classname | identifier |   id
-----------------+-----------+------------+---------
                | Strain    | 6_1083     | 1380031
```

We see this object is a Strain. We now know which type of data is not
being stored. We can then look in the attribute table to get the
identifier. Using the [id]{.title-ref} we can query the attribute table.

``` {.sql}
select * from attribute where itemid = 1380031;
```

This gives us any attributes stored for this object, in our example this
gives us the primary identifier.

``` {.sql}
intermine_value |       name        | itemid
-----------------+-------------------+---------
LS2329          | primaryIdentifier | 1380031
```
