Mac Installation Notes
======================

This is a work in progress, at the moment just some notes and useful
links.

Installing Tomcat
-----------------

Tomcat is easy to install by downloading the tar.gz file of the latest
release and extracting it, then you can get started almost immediately.

From the Tomcat website find the latest stable version in the Downloads
section, currently 6.0.x. Scroll to \'Binary Distributions\', \'Core\'
and save the [tar.gz]{.title-ref} file.

Extract this file with:

``` {.bash}
$ tar -zxvf apache-tomcat-6.0.x
```

Change into the apache-tomcat-6.0.x, the following directories are of
interest:

-   [bin]{.title-ref} - scripts to startup and shutdown tomcat
-   [logs]{.title-ref} - error logs are written here
-   [webapps]{.title-ref} - the directory web applications are deployed
    to
-   [conf]{.title-ref} - configuration files

Before starting you need to set up a mananger user so you can deploy web
applications and we recommend you allocate more RAM to tomcat -
\[wiki:Prerequisites\#Tomcat see here\]

Start up tomcat by running:

``` {.bash}
$ apache-tomcat-6.0.x/bin/startup.sh
```

To check tomcat is running try to access [localhost:8080]{.title-ref} in
a web browser, you should see a Tomcat home page. If you don\'t see the
tomcat page check [apache-tomcat-6.0.x/catalina.out]{.title-ref} and
[apache-tomcat-6.0.x/localhost-\<data\>.log]{.title-ref} for error
messages and consult the Tomcat docs

Installing Eclipse
------------------

Eclipse is a free, open-source Java editing environment, configuration
to open the various code modules in InterMine as Eclipse projects is
included in the checkout. You can download the Mac OS X version of
Eclipse from <http://www.eclipse.org/downloads>, either the standard or
EE edition will work fine. Just unzip the download and it will work
immediately.

See our guide to setting up InterMine in Eclipse: EclipseSetup.

For convenient startup from the Terminal command line you can put
[eclipse]{.title-ref} in your [\$PATH]{.title-ref} or create a link to
it, for example:

``` {.bash}
$ sudo ln -s /Applications/eclipse/eclipse /usr/local/bin/eclipse 
```

Apple has a guide to Eclipse at
<https://beginnersbook.com/2016/04/how-to-install-eclipse-on-mac-os-x/>.

Installing Postgres
-------------------

See <http://www.postgresql.org/download/macosx>. We\'ve had the most
success with MacPorts.
