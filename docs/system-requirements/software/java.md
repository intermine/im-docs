Java
====

We recommend you use OpenJDK rather than Sun\'s JDK. There isn\'t much
difference now between the two, as far as InterMine is concerned, but
going forward it\'s probably safer.

The version of Gradle we are using is compatible with Java 11.

GRADLE_OPTS
-----------

InterMine can be rather memory-intensive, so you will probably need to
set memory options for Java. To do this, set the environment variable
[GRADLE_OPTS]{.title-ref} to pass in to Java, by placing the following
line in your [\~/.bashrc]{.title-ref} file:

``` {.bash}
# ~/.bashrc file
$ export GRADLE_OPTS="-server -Xmx8g -XX:+UseParallelGC -Xms2g -XX:SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB=1 -XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=99 -Dorg.gradle.daemon=false"
```

Run [source]{.title-ref} to use this value in the current session.

You should change the [-Xmx]{.title-ref} and [-Xms]{.title-ref} values
if you have very little or very much RAM in your computer.

Building a database requires much more memory than running a webapp
only.
