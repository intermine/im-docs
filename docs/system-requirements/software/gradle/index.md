Gradle - Quick Start
====================

[Gradle](https://gradle.org) is InterMine\'s build tool. In InterMine
2.0 Gradle replaced ant.

Please see `Upgrade instructions </intermine/upgrade>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} for details on how to migrate your system to use Gradle and
`Gradle FAQs </system-requirements/software/gradle/FAQs>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} for commonly asked questions about Gradle.

Below are common commands you will use when building InterMine database
and deploying webapps. See
[docs.gradle.org](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/command_line_interface.html)
for the full list.

Data sources
------------

Previously all third party JARs were kept in the InterMine code
repository and the build compiled all InterMine dependencies. Now,
Gradle, via the Maven plugin, manage and download all JARs and only your
local project is compiled.

**To use local data sources**

``` {.sh}
~/git/flymine-bio-sources $ ./gradlew install
```

-   See the maven plugin docs on the [install
    task](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/maven_plugin.html)
    for details.
-   Example: <https://github.com/intermine/flymine-bio-sources> -
    FlyMine-specific data sources.
-   When installed locally, the JAR that is produced is available in the
    maven repo located in [\~/.m2/repository]{.title-ref}
-   The JARs downloaded as dependencies are available in the Gradle
    cache, [\~/.gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/]{.title-ref}.

::: {.note}
::: {.title}
Note
:::

The build is going to be looking at the resulting JAR created by this
command. If you make any changes to your data sources, install again to
update the JAR to make those changes visible to the build.
:::

**To use common data sources in the InterMine library**

-   No action required. Use project XML file as normal.

The migration script you used set up the dependency to the
[intermine-bio-sources]{.title-ref} project already. This project
includes [uniprot]{.title-ref} and other data sources, and are on the
classpath. During the build, the code will look for the uniprot jar,
e.g. [bio-source-uniprot-2.0.jar]{.title-ref} and find it on the
classpath successfully. Maven will download it for you.

Database
--------

Delete and recreate all database tables

``` {.sh}
~/git/flymine $ ./gradlew buildDB
```

Delete and recreate all database tables using a specific property file.

``` {.sh}
~/git/flymine $ ./gradlew buildDB -Dorg.gradle.project.release=dev
```

To run a single source

``` {.sh}
~/git/flymine $ ./gradlew integrate -Psource=uniprot  --stacktrace 
```

::: {.note}

Note

You can try \--info or \--debug too
:::

To run a single postprocess

``` {.sh}
~/git/flymine $ ./gradlew postprocess -Pprocess=do-sources --stacktrace
```

To run a full build

``` {.sh}
~/git/flymine $ ./project_build -b localhost /tmp/flymine-dump
```

We are using the same [project
build](https://github.com/intermine/intermine-scripts/blob/master/project_build)
script, but we\'ve moved it to the [intermine-scripts]{.title-ref}
repository with our other scripts.

Webapp
------

There are several ways to deploy your InterMine webapp. You can use
[cargo]{.title-ref} to deploy your webapp to a running Tomcat instance,
or [gretty]{.title-ref} to use an embedded Tomcat instance. Run
[./gradlew tasks]{.title-ref} to see all the available tasks.

We use [cargo]{.title-ref} for our production instances and
[gretty]{.title-ref} on our local dev machines.

### Deploy a webapp (cargo)

``` {.sh}
~/git/flymine $ ./gradlew cargoDeployRemote
~/git/flymine $ ./gradlew cargoRedeployRemote
~/git/flymine $ ./gradlew cargoUndeployRemote
```

Uses the config in the mine properties file, e.g.
[flymine.properties]{.title-ref}, to deploy the webapp, see below.

  Property name     Example       Determines
  ----------------- ------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  webapp.hostname   localhost     name of host. If not set, tries to use [webapp.deploy.url]{.title-ref}
  webapp.path       flymine       location of path of webapp
  webapp.manager    TOMCAT_USER   tomcat username, needed to deploy webapp
  webapp.password   TOMCAT_PWD    tomcat password, needed to deploy webapp
  webapp.protocol   https         OPTIONAL, defaults to http
  webapp.port       8081          OPTIONAL, defaults to 8080

::: {.warning}
::: {.title}
Warning
:::

Cargo uses hot deployment which over time fills up the PermGen memory of
the JVM process running your container. Continuously deploying an
artifact will inevitablity lead to a java.lang.OutOfMemoryError
:::

### Deploy a webapp (gretty)

``` {.sh}
~/git/flymine $ ./gradlew tomcatStartWar
~/git/flymine $ ./gradlew tomcatStop
```

-   Embedded tomcat, uses port 8080.
-   Logs are in \$HOME/logs, for more details:
    <http://akhikhl.github.io/gretty-doc/Logging.html>

### Deploy blue genes

``` {.sh}
~/git/flymine $ ./gradlew blueGenesStart
```

-   Gets the [mine name]{.title-ref}, [URL]{.title-ref} and tools
    location from the \$mine.properties file.
-   Uses the webservices from the webapp specified in the
    \$mine.properties file. For the time being, you have to have an
    InterMine webapp running to launch a bluegenes instance.
-   The app will be deployed at the specified [URL]{.title-ref},
    port 5000.
-   It is suggested to launch the app in the background (append
    [&]{.title-ref} to the command).
-   Please see `Blue genes </webapp/blue-genes/index>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} for details on how to configure your bluegenes instance.

Specify properties file
-----------------------

To use a specific properties file, set the file suffix with the
[-Dorg.gradle.project.release]{.title-ref} parameter like so:

``` {.sh}
~/git/flymine $ ./gradlew builddb -Dorg.gradle.project.release=dev
```

That command will build the database set in the
[flymine.properties.dev]{.title-ref} file.

Gradle
------

To see a list of command-line options, run

``` {.sh}
./gradlew --help
```

To see what tasks are available

``` {.sh}
./gradlew tasks
```

To get rid of compiled files

``` {.sh}
./gradlew clean
```

To update your local packages

``` {.sh}
./gradlew install
```

-   See
    `Local installation </system-requirements/software/git/>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} for how to install InterMine locally. (You shouldn\'t do
    this normally, instead use the JARs available via Maven).
-   Always use [./gradlew]{.title-ref} instead of [gradle]{.title-ref}.
    This is the wrapper that comes with InterMine and ensure that
    everyone is using the same version.

### Daemons

The updated Gradle version comes with [daemons]{.title-ref} enabled by
default. These are helper processes that exist in the background. This
can speed up builds for example but sometimes, under heavy development,
can cause problems when InterMine does not properly dereference assets.
We are working on fixing this! In the meantime, you should append
[-Dorg.gradle.daemon=false]{.title-ref} to your
[GRADLE_OPTS]{.title-ref} variable.

    docs](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_daemon.html)
