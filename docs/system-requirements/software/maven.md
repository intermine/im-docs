Maven
========

InterMine uses `Maven <https://maven.apache.org/>`_ to manage local dependencies, including your mine-specific data sources.

.. code-block:: bash
  
  # for Ubuntu
  sudo apt-get install maven

Previously you had to download and compile InterMine. Now, instead, youâ€™ll be using the compiled InterMine JARs available via jCenter. They will be automatically dowloaded and stored in the gradle cache ~/.gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/org.intermine/.

To use your mine-specific bio sources, you will install Maven locally. The install task, recompiles the bio-source code, creates a new jar and installs it in you local Maven. These JARs are located in ~/.m2.

.. index:: maven
