We have interesting problems to solve, both on the server and on the user-interface level. We deal with the issues of describing complex real world systems at the right level of abstraction. We work with the leaders in the fields of genomic life-sciences, helping them structure and manage their increasingly valuable knowledge bases. This data changes frequently, so we have built a system that can flexibly work from any description of a data-model to produce a clear and powerful data-mining interface. We need you to help develop and improve this sector leading product.
