Software Developer (Closure / JavaScript)
=================================================

Are you passionate about open source and making user friendly client-side web
applications? We’re a small team comprised of five developers (six, if you join us!) and a
biologist, looking for a developer to help us with ​ BlueGenes​ , an open source
Clojure​ -powered user interface for the biological data warehouse ​ InterMine​ .
Clojure/​ ClojureScript​ experience is​ not ​ required, so long as you have experience with
JavaScript and are willing to learn Clojure.
As well as working on BlueGenes, you’ll also get the chance to support some of our older
Javascript and CoffeeScript based applications and plugins. Development is likely to range
from data wrangling through to interface design and data visualisation. We’d like to find
someone who is comfortable collaborating with others on different aspects of the same
project.

Required skills and experience
------------------------------------

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript, some experience with Node.js
* Creating client-driven applications in JavaScript (or a language that compiles to
JavaScript) 
* Creating and maintaining tests (UI, integration, unit).
* Some experience with version control. We use git.

Bonus points for
--------------------------

* Experience with Clojure / ClojureScript, especially re-frame and reagent.
* Biology knowledge!

About InterMine
--------------------------

Our projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

InterMine​ is an open source Java-based data warehouse, integrating biological data in
varied formats into a PostgreSQL database. It also includes a legacy JSP user interface and
web services​ with ​ client libraries​ in R, Python, Perl, Ruby, Java, and JavaScript. ​ BlueGenes​ ,
the new user interface, loads its data via these web services and is in early beta release at
the moment.

Most InterMines are oriented around a certain organism or range of organisms, with ​ FlyMine
and ​ HumanMine​ run in-house by the core Cambridge team, with a variety of other InterMine
instances run by academic institutions around the world, from the UK and France to USA
and Japan.

Some of our other initiatives include
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* We currently have experimental prototype implementations of a ​ Neo4j-powered
backend​ .
* Native mobile applications for ​ Android​ and i ​ OS​ .
* Long-term plans include expanding InterMine to become a ​ cloud-based service​ with
a guided user set-up wizard so non-technical users can easily analyse their data.
* We have a ​ registry of production InterMine instances​ around the world.
