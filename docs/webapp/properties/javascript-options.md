Setting Javascript Options
===========================

Many of the javascript tools included in InterMine pages can be customized
at run-time with specific options. To do this the recommended practice is to
include a custom set of option configurations in a javascript file that is included
in your InterMine instance, or other embedding page. Do do this withing the
context of the InterMine web-application, we recommend following the following
steps:

* Create a new javascript file, named something like `model-includes.js`, and place 
  it in the `MINE_NAME/webapp/src/main/resources` directory.
* Add your options to the file (see below).
* Configure your mine to load this file on every page (see below).

Adding options to the file
----------------------------

If for instance you wanted to configure the result-tables so that their cell-previews
appeared on 'hover' rather than on 'click', which is the default, and also to enable the
'ChromosomeLocation' formatter, you would want the contents of your options file to be something
like:

::

  (jQuery(function() { // run when the page has loaded.
    if (intermine) {   // but only if there is something to do.
      intermine.setOptions({CellPreviewTrigger: 'hover'});
      intermine.setOptions({
        'Location.start': true,
        'Location.end': true
      }, 'intermine.results.formatsets.genomic');
    }
  });

Configuring your mine to load your custom file
------------------------------------------------

In one of your properties files (ideal your model web properties file), add a property beginning
with `head.js.all.` that names this file. If your file is `my-mine-options.js`, then this
line might look like:

::

  head.js.all.MY_JS_OPTIONS = my-mine-options.js
