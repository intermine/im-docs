# Text and messages

These files control much of the text in the web application:

**`InterMineWebApp.properties`**

Most of the text appearing on the webapp \(button names, forms, some help text, etc.\) are defined in this file. If you want the webapp to appear in a different language other than English, you will have to translate the file. This file is located in the InterMine webapp JAR.

[**model.properties**](https://github.com/intermine/flymine/blob/master/webapp/src/main/resources/model.properties)\*\*\*\*

Model specific properties. Merges with InterMineWebApp.properties, overwrites properties in that file.
