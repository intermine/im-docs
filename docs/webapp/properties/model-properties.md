Text and messages
========================================================

These files control much of the text in the web application:

`InterMineWebApp.properties`
   Most of the text appearing on the webapp (button names, forms, some help text, etc.) is defined in this file. If you want the webapp to appear in a different language than English, you will have to translate the file. This file is located in the InterMine webapp JAR.

`model.properties <https://github.com/intermine/flymine/blob/master/webapp/src/main/resources/model.properties>`_ 
   Model specific properties. Merges with InterMineWebApp.properties, overwrites properties in that file.
