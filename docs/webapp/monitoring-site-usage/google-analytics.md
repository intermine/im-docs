Google Analytics
================================

To enable Google Analytics to track usage of your webapp you need to set up your Analytics account and get a '''code''' from Google then add a property to your `.intermine/xxxmine.properties` file:

.. code-block:: xml

	google.analytics.id=CODE

This places the Google javascript to track usage views to every page of the webapp.

To modify the message that is going to be displayed to the user asking if they agree to the usage of cookies modify:

.. code-block:: xml

	google.analytics.message=I accept cookies from this site

If no key - message is provided, no message is shown and cookies are accepted by default.

.. index:: Google analytics
