This text describes how to customize the homepage of your mine.
:::

::: {.seealso}
`/webapp/layout/index`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} for whole app look
& feel.
:::

If you have just installed a new mine, your homepage probably looks
something like the following:

![image](img/initial_homepage.jpg)

In order to do any sort of customizations, one has to add/edit a
configuration file for the mine. You will find this file in
`webapp/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.properties`.

Open this file in your editor of choice and follow the text below.

Boxes Customization
-------------------

The three prominent boxes on the homepage will contain a search
functionality a list upload functionality and an info box. You can
customise the text these contain and the box title.

### Search box

The first search box is configured thusly:

``` {.properties}
begin.searchBox.title = Search
begin.searchBox.description = Search FlyMine. Enter <strong>names</strong>, <strong>identifiers</strong> \
or <strong>keywords</strong> for genes, proteins, pathways, ontology terms, authors, etc. (e.g. \
<em>eve</em>, HIPPO_DROME, glycolysis, <em>hb</em> allele).
```

::: {.note}
::: {.title}
Note
:::

You will find that only the description field accepts HTML.
:::

### Second box

``` {.properties}
begin.listBox.title = List Upload
begin.listBox.description = Enter a <strong>list</strong> of identifiers.

bag.example.identifiers=CG9151, FBgn0000099, CG3629, TfIIB, Mad, CG1775, CG2262, TWIST_DROME, \
tinman, runt, E2f, CG8817, FBgn0010433, CG9786, CG1034, ftz, FBgn0024250, FBgn0001251, tll, \
CG1374, CG33473, ato, so, CG16738, tramtrack,  CG2328, gt
```

### Third box

The third/info box can contain a descriptive text about your mine or it
can offer a link to a tour of the project. Take the example from FlyMine
project:

``` {.properties}
begin.thirdBox.title = First Time Here?
begin.thirdBox.description = FlyMine integrates many types of data for <em>Drosophila</em>, \
<em>Anopheles</em> and other organisms. You can run flexible queries, export results and analyse lists of \
data.
begin.thirdBox.link = http://www.flymine.org/help/tour/start.html
begin.thirdBox.linkTitle = Take a tour
```

By providing the .link parameter a button will be shown at the bottom of
the box with a custom link of choice.

You can serve up a custom text in the third \"information\" box to the
user, based on whether they have visited the homepage before or not. We
do this through a cookie that will, for a year, indicate for your
computer, that the homepage has been visited.

In order to change the values of the third box based on whether the user
has visited the page or not, prepend the text \"visited\" before an
uppercased key. For example, if one wanted to say \"Welcome Back\"
instead of \"First Time Here?\" as the title of the box, we would add
the following key=value pair:

``` {.properties}
begin.thirdBox.visitedTitle = Welcome Back
```

The fields that you do NOT set in this way, will simply show the text
configured in the normal way. So even though someone has visited the
homepage before, unless I add a \"visited\" property, the text stays the
same as before.

Popular Templates Customization
-------------------------------

To show the ten most popular template queries per category on your
homepage:

![image](img/popular_templates.jpg)

Example:

``` {.properties}
# web.properties
begin.tabs.1.id = Genomics
```

What this configuration does is it creates a tab on the homepage with
(up to) 10 most popular templates from a [Genomics]{.title-ref}
category. For a template to appear in this section, tag it with the
Genomics aspect: [im:aspect:Genomics]{.title-ref}.

::: {.note}
::: {.title}
Note
:::

The tag you apply to the template (e.g.
[im:aspect:Genomics]{.title-ref}) must match the value of the
[id]{.title-ref} attribute (e.g. [begin.tabs.1.id =
Genomics]{.title-ref}).
:::

The number in the config key specifies the order in which we want to
show them. So if we have two categories, Genomics and Proteins, and they
should appear in this order, we would write this:

``` {.properties}
begin.tabs.1.id = Genomics
begin.tabs.2.id = Proteins
```

The other customisation we can do is specify an informative text that is
to appear in the tab above the templates listing (again, this text
accepts HTML.):

``` {.properties}
begin.tabs.1.id = Genomics
begin.tabs.1.description = This is some descriptive text
```

The last thing we will show is how to specify a custom category name to
show as a link on the tab (entirely optional):

``` {.properties}
begin.tabs.1.id = Genomics
begin.tabs.1.description = This is some descriptive text
begin.tabs.1.name = Genes
```

Example configuration file:
[FlyMine](https://github.com/intermine/flymine/blob/master/webapp/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.properties#L489)

Featured Lists
--------------

Lists with tag `im:homepage` will be shown on the homepage below the
templates listing in a natural order, and/or an order specified by
`im:order:n`.

To change the description text associated with this set of lists, edit
the properties file like so:

``` {.properties}
begin.listsBox.description = These are the best lists ever
```

RSS/Blog Feed
-------------

To add the RSS feed at the bottom right corner of the page, add the
following to your MINE properties file (in `.intermine` file):

``` {.properties}
project.rss = http://<your_blog>/<your_feed_url>
```

eg:

``` {.properties}
project.rss=http://blog.flymine.org/?feed=rss2
```

Two latest entries will be shown in the box. If you want to provide a
link underneath the entry listing to your blog, add the following to the
config file:

``` {.properties}
links.blog = http://<your_blog>
```
