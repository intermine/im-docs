Diagnostic
=============

Occasionally something may go wrong with your webapp - your webapp may fail to load in your browser, not reflect your most recent changes and so on. In our experience, following the steps listed here should fix ~99% of any problems you encounter.

Restart Tomcat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Restarting Tomcat may fix your issue. If you find you have to restart Tomcat often, you may want to give Tomcat more memory.

Also, if in a deadlock, Tomcat may not shutdown successfully. Be sure to check the Tomcat process really is gone before starting a new one.

Verify MINE.properties file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `base-url` property must valid or else queries will not run properly.

This file must live in the `.intermine` directory.

Verify Tomcat config
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please make sure you have configured Tomcat correctly. See :doc:`/system-requirements/software/tomcat`

Force recompile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run this command in your `webapp` directory:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ ./gradlew clean

Verify `/build` is gone from your `webapp` directory.

Re-release webapp
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

	$ ./gradlew cargoReDeployRemote
