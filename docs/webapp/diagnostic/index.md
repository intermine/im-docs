Diagnostic
==========

Occasionally something may go wrong with your webapp - your webapp may
fail to load in your browser, not reflect your most recent changes and
so on. In our experience, following the steps listed here should fix
\~99% of any problems you encounter.

Restart Tomcat
--------------

Restarting Tomcat may fix your issue. If you find you have to restart
Tomcat often, you may want to give Tomcat more memory.

Also, if in a deadlock, Tomcat may not shutdown successfully. Be sure to
check the Tomcat process really is gone before starting a new one.

Verify MINE.properties file
---------------------------

The [base-url]{.title-ref} property must valid or else queries will not
run properly.

This file must live in the [.intermine]{.title-ref} directory.

Verify Tomcat config
--------------------

Please make sure you have configured Tomcat correctly. See
`/system-requirements/software/tomcat`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}

Force recompile
---------------

Run this command in your [webapp]{.title-ref} directory:

``` {.bash}
$ ./gradlew clean
```

Verify [/build]{.title-ref} is gone from your [webapp]{.title-ref}
directory.

Re-release webapp
-----------------

``` {.bash}
$ ./gradlew cargoReDeployRemote
```
