Link redirects
================================

You can add a property to WebProperties to have links in results forward the user to a URL instead of the InterMine report page.

config
-------

Add the following to your WebProperties file:

.. code-block:: properties

	# used to redirect links in webapp
	webapp.linkRedirect=org.intermine.bio.web.BioLinkRedirectManager

	# links to intermine report pages will be replaced with these URLs
	externallink.[uniqueID].[class].[taxonId].[field].url = [full URL]

uniqueId
	any string, should be different for each entry, internal use only

class
 	class of Object to redirect, eg. Gene or Protein

taxonId
	taxon ID or * if config should apply to all

field
	which identifier field to pass to the URL, eg. if field is primaryIdentifier, the value of primary identifier will be used as the attribute value

full URL
	full http address, eg. http://www.google.co.uk/#q=monkey

All columns in the results for the configured class will be links to the external URL.  
 

examples
--------

In results pages, all dmel genes will link to FlyBase with Gene.primaryIdentifier instead of the Mine report page:

.. code-block:: properties

	externallink.flybaseResults.Gene.7227.primaryIdentifier.url=http://www.flybase.org/.bin/fbidq.html?<<attributeValue>>
	

One could also use a common URL with a common hostname and different subdirectory names. Intermine then figures out what URL to build with the given subdirectory name and redirects your query to that mine Report page using the Identifier you provide as an external identifier.
common subdirectory names include:

MOUSEMINE = intermine.org/mgi

YEASTMINE = intermine.org/sgd

ZEBRAFISHMINE = intermine.org/zfin

WORMMINE = intermine.org/wormbase

RATMINE = intermine.org/rgd

METABOLICMINE = (Please update) 

So an externallink to RATMINE will look like this: 
.. code-block:: properties 

	externallink.flybaseResults.Gene.10116.primaryIdentifier.url=http://www.intermine.org/rgd/portal.do?externalids<<attributeValue>>&class=Gene&origin=Ratmine	
	

In results pages, all probesets will link to Google instead of the Mine report page:

.. code-block:: properties

	externallink.foo.ProbeSet.*.primaryIdentifier.url=http://www.google.com?q=<<attributeValue>>

Next to the value in the column will be a small icon indicating an external link

.. index:: redirects, link redirects
