Overwrite any JSP
------------------------

When the webapp is compiled, the order of projects is:

#. intermine/webapp
#. bio/webapp        <-- overwrites files in intermine/webapp
#. MINE_NAME/webapp <-- overwrites files in intermine/webapp and bio/webapp

You can overwrite any JSP in the intermine or bio/webapp projects by having a JSP of the same name in your mine's webapp directory.  The danger of this is that you will have to upgrade these JSPs manually.
