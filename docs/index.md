InterMine documentation
================================

`InterMine <http://www.intermine.org/>`_ is an open source data warehouse built specifically for the integration and analysis of complex biological data.

Developed by the `Micklem lab <http://www.micklemlab.org/>`_ at the `University of Cambridge <https://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/>`_, InterMine enables the creation of biological databases accessed by sophisticated web query tools. Parsers are provided for integrating data from many common biological data sources and formats, and there is a framework for adding your own data. InterMine includes an attractive, user-friendly web interface that works 'out of the box' and can be easily customised for your specific needs, as well as a powerful, scriptable web-service API to allow programmatic access to your data.
