InterMine documentation
=======================

[InterMine](http://www.intermine.org/) is an open source data warehouse
built specifically for the integration and analysis of complex
biological data.

Developed by the [Micklem lab](http://www.micklemlab.org/) at the
[University of Cambridge](https://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/), InterMine enables
the creation of biological databases accessed by sophisticated web query
tools. Parsers are provided for integrating data from many common
biological data sources and formats, and there is a framework for adding
your own data. InterMine includes an attractive, user-friendly web
interface that works \'out of the box\' and can be easily customised for
your specific needs, as well as a powerful, scriptable web-service API
to allow programmatic access to your data.
